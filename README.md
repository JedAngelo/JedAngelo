## Professional Philosophy

> “Building a clean and maintainable codebase is just as important as delivering features. I strive for my code to be performant and efficient, but above all, understandable and inviting for any developer who wishes to contribute. If my work can make someone’s development experience smoother, I consider that a success.”

## Beyond Software

Outside of software development, I am an avid reader with a passion for both fiction and non-fiction literature. I also enjoy exploring the rich narratives found in manga.
